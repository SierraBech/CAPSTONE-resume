    <!-- Somewhere you can make another html file and can copy and paste all of hobbies and stick it inside the file and then name it hobbies.html. Then, when you go back to your original html file, where the hobbies used to be, you can just add a hyperlink reference for Hobbies and then you have a click through link that has the list of hobbies, rather than all the info being on one page! yeah, i hope that makes sense future me-->
